## 🚀 Creating the GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd worktree-manager
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Git Worktree Manager v1.0.0

- Complete worktree management with automatic config copying
- Shell integration with convenient aliases and functions
- Comprehensive test suite with 60+ tests
- Location-independent operation from any git directory
- Smart branch handling for local, remote, and new branches
- Configurable file copying with persistent settings"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `git-worktree-manager`
3. Description: `Comprehensive command-line tool for managing git worktrees with automatic configuration file copying and shell integration`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Connect and Push
```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/git-worktree-manager.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

**Topics/Tags** (for discoverability):
- git
- worktree

- ✅ Enable Wiki
- ✅ Enable Projects
- ✅ Enable Sponsorships (if desired)

**Branch Protection** (recommended):

- Include administrators

## 📦 Release Management

### Creating Releases
```bash
# Tag the current version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Initial public release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### GitHub Release
1. Go to repository → Releases → "Create a new release"
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: `Git Worktree Manager v1.0.0`
4. Description: Copy from `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Attach pre-built assets if needed
